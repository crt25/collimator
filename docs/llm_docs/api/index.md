# Tutorial: api

This project is a web API for a learning platform, likely for programming education (e.g., Scratch).
It manages different types of users: *Teachers* and *Administrators* (collectively **Users**) who manage content, and **Students** who participate in learning activities.
Key features include:
- Secure **Authentication** & **Authorization** to control who can access what.
- Managing *Classes*, *Tasks* (assignments), and live learning *Sessions*.
- Handling student *Solutions* submissions for tasks, including file storage and analysis (like converting code to an Abstract Syntax Tree - AST).
- Supporting both regular logged-in students and *anonymous* participation in specific sessions.


**Source Repository:** [None](None)
