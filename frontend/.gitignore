# When .babelrc is there, the SWC compiler is not run (https://nextjs.org/docs/architecture/nextjs-compiler#unsupported-features)
# Because SWC is faster, we do not want a custom babel config.
# Unfortunately we need one for the coverage collection in the tests.
# The scripts temporarily create the file in this place and then delete it again.
# Putting it in the .gitignore prevents the file from being committed accidentally.
